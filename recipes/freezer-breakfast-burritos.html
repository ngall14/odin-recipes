    <h1>Freezer Breakfast Burritos</h1>
    <img src="../img/breakfastBurritos.jpeg" alt="a stack of breakfast burritos">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Flavorful turkey meatballs coated in the most delicious sweet and spicy sauce made 
        with a combination of sriracha, soy sauce, ginger, honey and garlic. The honey and 
        soy sauce in this recipe really balance out the heat perfectly, but if this sauce 
        is too hot for you, I recommend just cutting the sriracha in half.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 lb breakfast or pork sausage</li>
        <li>2 cups frozen diced potatoes</li>
        <li>6 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tbsp half and half</li>
        <li>8 medium tortillas</li>
        <li>3/4 cup shredded cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In a medium pan, cook sausage until done. Place on a plate and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Thaw potatoes and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            In the same pan, add a tablespoon of butter and melt.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a mixing bowl, whisk eggs with half and half. Season with salt and pepper. 
            Pour egg mixture into the pan with butter. Gently swirling with a spatula or 
            wooden spoon, cook eggs until they reach desired texture. Remove from pan onto 
            plate. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Lay out tortillas on a cutting board. Top with equal amounts of filling, starting 
            with eggs, then sausage, then potatoes. Top with cheese. Fold in sides of the 
            tortilla to the center. Roll up burrito-style. Wrap in a sheet of freezer paper 
            and place in a ziploc bag.
        </li>
        <li>
            Freeze for up to 3 months.
        </li>
        <li>
            To reheat: unwrap burrito and set on a microwave safe plate. Heat for 45 to 60 
            seconds or until heated through. 
        </li>
    </ol>
