    <h1>Sriracha Meatballs</h1>
    <img src="../img/srirachaMeatballs.jpg" alt="meal prepped sriracha meatballs with rice">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Flavorful turkey meatballs coated in the most delicious sweet and spicy sauce made 
        with a combination of sriracha, soy sauce, ginger, honey and garlic. The honey and 
        soy sauce in this recipe really balance out the heat perfectly, but if this sauce 
        is too hot for you, I recommend just cutting the sriracha in half.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the meatballs:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs lean ground turkey</li>
        <li>1 cup whole wheat panko breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 green onions, chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup Sriracha</li>
        <li>3 tbsp reduced sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>3 tbsp rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp graded fresh ginger</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp sesame oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large bowl, mix together turkey, breadcrumbs,eggs, green onion, 
            garlic powder, and salt/pepper until well combined. Shape mixture into 
            1-1/2 inch balls (makes roughly 40 balls) and place spaced apart on 
            prepared baking sheets lightly sprayed with cooking spray.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake meatballs for 20 to 25 minutes, or until browned and cooked through.
        </li>
        <li>
            While the meatballs are baking, combine all the ingredients for the 
            sauce in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat, whisking 
            continuously. Reduce heat and simmer for 8 to 10 minutes (the sauce will 
            start to thicken) then toss with the meatballs.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve immediately over brown rice and top with green onions and a few 
            sesame seeds. Enjoy!
