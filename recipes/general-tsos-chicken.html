        General Tso's Chicken made in a slow cooker is the perfect easy weeknight meal. 
        Best of all, this healthier recipe for a popular takeout dish has the same amazing 
        flavors as your local Chinese restaurant. Made in your crock-pot or Instant Pot 
        pressure cooker!

        Enjoy the General Tsoâ€™s chicken alone or serve it with some quinoa, rice or even 
        zoodles or cauliflower rice for a lower carb option.
